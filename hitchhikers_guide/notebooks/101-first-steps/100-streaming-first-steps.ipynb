    "# Delta Lake Tables\n",
    "We will learn to create an `empty` Delta Lake table next. There are many reasons that you'll want to create empty tables, for one, this allows you to create the `promise` of eventual data, while first getting things like the tables `schema` locked into place. If none of this is making sense yet, then never fear, you'll learn about `schemas` and `tblproperties` next.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall, we used a `StructType` to create a schema when we read the `ecomm_behavior_data` in the [100-pre-processing](../100-pre-processing/ecomm_csv_to_parquet.ipynb) notebook. The StructType is to DataFrames, like a structured data is to a Table row, both are strongly typed and provide a bit of peace of mind when working with a dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Data is also one of the most important concepts to keep in mind while working with Streaming datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structured Data as our Data Contract\n",
    "Delta Lake uses a technique called `schema-on-write`. This means that all data being written by the `writer` or `producer` of a dataset must conform to a known `schema` after the initial `write` which in Delta Lake encapsulates a `transaction`. After the **initial write transaction**, which occurs at the time of table **creation**, a schema will exist. The importance of the `schema` is that it is `type-safe`. Type saftey with our data is also of critical importance for streaming, since a change in type, say from `string` to `integer` would break `backwards-compatibility` and `corrupt` our table. We don't want corrupt tables, so using `schema-on-write` and `schema-enforcement`, both tenents of the Delta Lake architecture, we can rest assured that any changes to our `schema` is backwards compatible*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> note and warning: (*) in the case where we must break backwards compatibility, we can, but it comes at the cost of `overwriting` the entire table and `schema`. This pattern is ripe for broken promises in the case where communication of a breaking-change, isn't broadcast to any downstream consumer (someone or some team that is relying on your data for their data product).\n",
