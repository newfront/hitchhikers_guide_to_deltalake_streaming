Funny Story: 100, 101, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107 kind of had good categories

This section will provide you with the right examples, and mental models to get started with [Delta Rust](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs), [Flink Delta Connector](https://github.com/delta-io/connectors/tree/master/flink), as well as [Kafka Delta Ingest](https://github.com/delta-io/kafka-delta-ingest). 

> Note: This is continous work in progress. Please open up an [Issue](https://github.com/newfront/hitchhikers_guide_to_deltalake_streaming/issues) if you find things that seem out of place. Just be nice.
