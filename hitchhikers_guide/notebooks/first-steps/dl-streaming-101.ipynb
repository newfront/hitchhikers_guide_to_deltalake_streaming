    "# Cleaning up with Vacuum.\n",
    "We are done with the introduction to Streaming. The First steps covers creating tables, and modifying the table properties, as well as understanding a little more about the structure of a Delta Lake table. During normal processing, you most likely overwrote, or deleted some data, for each transaction that affects the data in a given Delta Lake table, there are some artifacts (call it orphaned data or files) that are no longer needed for the *CURRENT* version of the Delta Lake table. We will learn more about using `vacuum` while preserving enough history to `undo`, `rewind`, or `time-travel` to a particular point in Table Time under "
